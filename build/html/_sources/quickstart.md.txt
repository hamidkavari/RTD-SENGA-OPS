# Quickstart (run your first case)

Assuming you built `senga2_mpi` or a GPU variant, you can run test problems with `mpirun` or a scheduler like Slurm.

## CPU (MPI)

```bash
mpirun -np 4 ./senga2_mpi -OPS_DIAGS=2 \
  OPS_FORCE_DECOMP_X=2 OPS_FORCE_DECOMP_Y=2 OPS_FORCE_DECOMP_Z=1 \
  2>&1 | tee log_mpi.txt
  ```
